In this task, I coded along with Scrimba to create a carousel to cycle through various pictures with simple arrow buttons. 
In this project I covered: 

- Keyframes
- Moving items
- hiding and displaying items
- positioning of buttons
- arial-labels for accessibility 

The project is live [here](https://zenidith.github.io/carousel/)

Happy Coding!
